## Useful infos

- start the servers: 'npm run dev' - this will start both server and client side servers
- in mongoDB there are 2 DBs, both for dev and prod. If any of them gets inactivated, just a click to re-activate it in the browser
- in the mongoUri there is a separate password for the root, this is not the same as the password for the account
